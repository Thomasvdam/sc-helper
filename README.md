# SoundCloud Helper

A hacky collection of utilities wrapped in a Chrome extension that make my SoundCloud experience better. Wanted a small project to see how the V3 extensions worked and improve my life at the same time.

It is tailored to my needs, but perhaps you can find something useful in here to help you build something similar.

## TODOs/Nice to haves

- [ ] Add directly to playlist. Not sure how to achieve this though without going through the API with an auth token... Perhaps I can hijack the token somehow and send it to the content script.
- [x] Migrate to TS and add a build step.
- [ ] Move hardcoded config to an extensions settings page.
- [ ] Integrate playlist utility script.
- [ ] Dynamically build the manifest file.
- [ ] Add track length check to playlist utility.
- [ ] Error handling. (lol)
- [ ] Logging. (lolololol)
- [ ] Design. (yeah no not gonna happen)
